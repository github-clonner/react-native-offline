# Contributing Guide
1. Make sure you have read and understand the **Motivation** section to be aligned with project history and goals.
2. Before submitting a PR please comment in the relevant issue (or create a new one if it doesn't exist yet) to discuss all the requirements (this will prevent rejecting the PR and wasting your work).
3. All workflow scripts (prettier, linter, tests) must pass successfully.
4. Provide relevant code coverage by means of unit tests.
